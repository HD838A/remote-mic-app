## SayAll MCP

- Reference revision: `eaac711`
- License: MIT

The bundled native Swift `SayAllMCP` Helper preserves the upstream project's local-history data paths, append-only authorization format, client environment variables, read-only tool names, query fields, pagination behavior, and privacy boundaries. It is a native implementation for app distribution and does not bundle Node.js, the upstream JavaScript build output, or npm dependencies.

## remote-bridge-hub

- Project: `xxb26553663-star/remote-bridge-hub`
- Source: <https://github.com/xxb26553663-star/remote-bridge-hub>
- Reference revision: `8a93f321ac71a602300c6cd77f7256fa4b63068e`
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0 only (`GPL-3.0-only`)

The Xiaomi RC003 ATVV UUIDs, microphone command behavior, IMA/DVI ADPCM decoding order, capability parsing, and HID usage mapping were adapted from this project. The macOS implementation uses Apple public frameworks and does not include the upstream Windows injection, VB-CABLE packaging, commercial branding, or customer systems.

## BlackHole

- Project: `ExistentialAudio/BlackHole`
- Source: <https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole>
- Pinned source revision: `v0.7.1` / `e2b22aaaba4e507a097131704bf96dabc004d9cf`
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (`GPL-3.0`)

BlackHole remains an optional loopback-device choice. This fork includes `scripts/build-doubao-driver.sh` and `third_party/blackhole/blackhole-device-usb.patch`, which build a distinct `MiRemoteV2ch.driver` from the pinned BlackHole source. The patch changes only the actual Audio Device transport type to USB and assigns a separate CFPlugIn factory UUID; it does not modify an installed `BlackHole2ch.driver`. The release build embeds the derived driver in a dedicated macOS Installer package. End users install that package from the DMG and do not need the source build tools.

## MiRemoteVoice

- Project: `VincentKingHsu/MiRemoteVoice`
- Source: <https://github.com/VincentKingHsu/MiRemoteVoice>
- Reference release: `v1.0.0-beta.1`
- Application license: MIT

The Doubao compatibility design is informed by MiRemoteVoice: a side-by-side BlackHole-derived device reports its actual audio Device as USB transport so Doubao can enumerate it. This fork reimplements that idea as a pinned, source-built BlackHole patch instead of reusing MiRemoteVoice's version-specific binary replacement script.

## RC003 product photo

The RC003 product photo bundled as `RC003-remote-photo.png` was supplied by the user on 2026-07-17 for the physical-button mapping interface. It is preserved at its original 508 x 1030 aspect ratio. Copyright and trademark rights in the photo and depicted products remain with their respective owners; the GPL-3.0-only license for the program does not grant additional rights to this image or the Xiaomi marks.
